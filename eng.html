                        <h2>General Rental Conditions for Self-Drive Classic Cars (as of 05/2023)</h2>
                        <p class="space">The vehicle complies with the Road Traffic Regulations. The tenant is required to present a German ID or EU passport and a driver's license valid in Germany upon handover, and by receiving the car at the agreed date, confirms that it is without noticeable defects, roadworthy with proper tires and vehicle registration (also an option for Garmin GPS Navi, "Concorde" picnic basket for 4 people, picnic blanket), as well as a brief user manual. Payment of the rental fee is due in cash when picking up the car, or the rental fee is due upon signing the contract and must be transferred to the account mentioned below within 2 weeks. There is comprehensive insurance with a deductible of € 300 per claim. The tenant assures that they have held a driver's license, written in the Roman alphabet and valid in Germany, for at least 5 years and will not use the vehicle for commercial or illegal purposes. The tenant/driver must have completed their 23rd year of age. If someone other than the tenant drives the car, they are always considered an agent of the tenant. In this case, the tenant is responsible for ensuring the driver's minimum age and checking their valid driver's license.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">Renting a classic car starts and ends at the address Olgastraße 9, 88045 Friedrichshafen or another previously agreed-upon location. The daily rental lasts 23 hours, starting at 9:00 AM and ending at 8:00 AM the next day. The start and end of the rental period can also be arranged differently in advance. If the tenant cannot provide a garage for the classic car overnight, as previously mentioned, they are obliged to return the vehicle to the landlord by 9:00 PM.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">The tenant is obliged to familiarize themselves with the operation of the classic car before starting their journey, especially considering the vehicle technology corresponds to the standards of the 60s-70s. It is specifically pointed out that driving a historic car in today's traffic requires a defensive driving style. The classic car has summer tires mounted all year round, which have a longer braking distance at temperatures below 7°C. The vehicle must be treated properly and gently; a speed of 100 km/h must not be exceeded. The tenant must always ensure that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition. The rental classic car may not be transported on a trailer without the landlord's permission.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">Driving on racetracks (e.g., Nürburgring, etc.) or participating in motorsport rallies is strictly prohibited.</p>

                        <p class="space">Foreign Travels:
                            Please note, as a self-driver, you're only allowed to enter Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Italy with rental vehicles. Entry into all other countries is prohibited or only allowed with the landlord's permission. Violating the terms for foreign travel will void all insurances.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">When refueling, it is essential to ensure that only Super Petrol (95 Octane) is used, and Super with E10 should not be used, as this can damage the engine. If the rental period exceeds 500 km, the tenant is obliged to check the oil level and, if necessary, only refill with Motul Type 20 W 50 oil (the oil is located in the vehicle's trunk). If a clearly recognizable defect is observed, the tenant is also obligated to immediately stop the vehicle in a suitable place, turn off the engine, and notify the landlord.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">In case of a breakdown, the landlord should be contacted immediately. The tenant has the right to commission a breakdown service to fix the problem on the spot. If a more extensive repair is required, the tenant must immediately report the incident to the landlord by phone or possibly leave a message on the answering machine with the location and time, and must wait for a response from the landlord within 1 hour. Receipts for advanced costs must include the date, location, and car license plate. In case of an accident, the tenant must secure the accident site according to the Road Traffic Regulations and always inform the police. The landlord must also be informed immediately.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">It is not allowed to smoke in the car, drive it through a car wash, or wash it in any way to avoid damaging the vehicle. It is essential to ensure the roof is entirely closed when it's raining or when the car is left unattended. Adhesive tapes and other residues, possibly from attached floral decorations, which can't be removed with a standard car wash, must be entirely removed before returning the vehicle. It's prohibited to stand on the seats or bumpers with shoes. Animals, especially dogs, are only allowed on the seats if the tenant ensures through appropriate coverings that neither dirt nor moisture can get on the seats and no animal odor remains. The tenant shouldn't wash the car before returning it, but if the vehicle is excessively dirty, additional cleaning costs will be charged to the tenant.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">The rental fee is due 100% in advance upon contract conclusion. If the rental agreement is canceled up to 4 weeks before the rental start, 25% of the rental price is charged; up to 1 week before, it's 50%. After that, the entire rental price is due. Further individual agreements are reserved for the landlord. The rental price already includes a specific number of kilometers; each additional kilometer is charged according to the rate on the price list/handover protocol.</p>

                        <p class="space">The tenant may exceed the agreed return time by a maximum of 30 minutes. If the car has not returned by then, the rental period is automatically extended by one more day at the daily rental rate according to the valid price list. The vehicle must be returned with a full tank; otherwise, the amount per liter of the estimated fuel shortage will be charged (there's also the option to refuel the car with the landlord at a nearby gas station after returning). Upon the car's return, the tenant and the landlord will jointly complete the return protocol, specifying the vehicle's condition.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">Tenant's Liability:
                            The tenant releases the landlord from any liability for transported luggage. The tenant is liable for accident damage and subsequent damage to the vehicle up to the amount of the deductible mentioned above. In any case, the tenant is fully liable for damage caused by intent, gross negligence, or impairment due to alcohol or drug use, as well as non-compliance with instructions during the technical briefing. Driving or riding in the classic car during the rental period is at each passenger's own risk/liability; the tenant is obliged to inform all passengers of this fact. If the vehicle stays with the tenant overnight, from 11 pm, they must generally provide a parking space in a garage or a locked or supervised property, including hotel parking lots. Overnight street parking is not allowed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="space">Landlord's Warranty and Reimbursement:
                            In the event of an unpredictable total failure of the vehicle before or during the rental period, the landlord is not obliged to provide a replacement car. This is explicitly at the landlord's discretion. However, if a replacement car is provided, the rental agreement transfers to the replacement vehicle under the same conditions. In the event of a total breakdown of the classic car, for reasons not the tenant's fault, the landlord only covers the retrieval of a broken-down vehicle or expenses for breakdown assistance and recovery costs based on presented receipts within a radius of max. 150 km around the landlord's location. Beyond this radius, the tenant is responsible for the professional return transport of a defective vehicle until the agreed return date, at their own expense. The landlord, therefore, strongly recommends that the tenant checks or takes out new membership in a breakdown service/protection letter, e.g., with ADAC, AVD, or similar, before starting the rental.</p>
                        
                            <p class="space">In the event of a total vehicle breakdown not caused by the tenant, the landlord will fully refund the rental price of the subsequent rental days. For the particular day of the breakdown, the rental price will be refunded proportionally based on the actual distance driven compared to the underlying free daily kilometers or time. The tenant expressly acknowledges that the vehicle corresponds to the technical standards of the 60s-70s in terms of passenger protection during an accident (e.g., lack of headrests). The tenant has been explicitly informed about the inferior driving/braking behavior of vintage vehicles compared to new ones; any resulting damage/injuries to the tenant or passengers are excluded from the landlord's liability. Furthermore, the tenant cannot make any further claims for reimbursements/compensations. Liability for intent and negligence is excluded.</p>

                            <h3 class="space">What to do in bad weather?</h3>
                            <p class="space">First and foremost: if the vehicle owner and guest driver agree, which is mostly the case, the booking can be postponed for up to two months from the original date at no cost. This can be easily done via our website. Usually, neither the guest driver nor the vehicle owner is keen on sharing the vehicle in bad weather: the guest driver has more fun driving, can spend more time outdoors, and has fewer constraints if he uses the vehicle on a good weather day. Lack of rust protection and various hollow spaces where moisture often settles mean that most vintage and youngtimer owners prefer to keep their car in the garage in bad weather, not to mention the reduced safety of older cars. Due to these shared interests, the booking can usually be easily postponed for up to six weeks. If bad weather makes it impossible to rent a car and the tenant does not agree to reschedule the rental, the full amount will be refunded if he had previously deposited it into the account. If this is important to you when booking, it's best to mention it to the vehicle owner during your booking request.</p>
                            
                            <p class="space">Any fines imposed during the rental period of the respective vehicle are paid by the tenant.</p>
                            
                            <p class="space">Severability Clause:
                                If any of the above provisions are ineffective, the remaining provisions remain unaffected. The ineffective provision is considered replaced by one that comes closest in legally effective manner to the intent and purpose of the ineffective provision. The same applies to potential regulatory gaps.</p>
                            
                            <p class="space-big">The aforementioned rental conditions are recognized. If disregarded/violated, the signatory is also liable to the landlord for direct damages.</p>
